# memory-reader

Yet another memory reader in C++20 (or newer).

This project is under consideration.

## Features

Please note not all features below have been implemented, since this project is under development â€” check it out later.

- Easy to use in both casual applications and complicated scenarios.

  The mechanism is to be designed.

- Fast and robust.

  The mechanism is to be designed.

- Cross-platform.

  memory-reader uses CMake to organize its source codes, and is designed to work with multiple operating systems. Currently it supports Windows and Linux.

## Motivation

It has been 2 years since the debut of my project [osu-memory](https://github.com/UnnamedOrange/osu-memory). Its simplicity, reliability, and performance have yet to be tested, while its project management has already failed to meet the needs of modern software development. Worse, I am still confronted with software crisis, desperately longing for a sample project that can be safely used in the real world.

I hope this project can help me attain:

- Methodology of cross-platform library development using software engineering.
- Experience in designing high-performance and robust programs.
- First step towards the next major release of osu-memory, osu-kps, and...
